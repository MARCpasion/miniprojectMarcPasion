            <p>This 45-meter bell tower in Ilocos Norte was built by the Augustinians in 1612 and was once one of the tallest bell tower in the Philippines back then. Although it belongs to St. Williams Cathedral, this structure is 85 meters away from the church. Funny thing, isn't it?

            <p>is located at the southeastern part of Laoag City. Even before the coming of the Spaniards, the hill was already the dwelling of early people of Laoag, where they built their houses compactly arranged around it. The natives must have chosen this spot for the location of their community not only for its proximity to the river which is indespensable to them as the source of food and water for drinking. Before the end of the 16th century, the missionaries, in their desire to improve the living conditions of the natives, resettled the big center of Laoag from Ermita Hill to its present location, the site of now the Aurora Park.
